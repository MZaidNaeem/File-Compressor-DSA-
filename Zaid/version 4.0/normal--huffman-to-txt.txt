War is a devastating conflict between nations or groups, often resulting in immense human suffering, destruction, and loss of life. It arises from a variety of causes, including political power struggles, territorial disputes, religious or ideological differences, and economic ambitions. While some argue that war can bring about change or justice, its consequences are almost always tragicâ€”displacing families, damaging infrastructure, and leaving deep emotional and psychological scars. History shows that even when wars end, their effects linger for generations, making peace and diplomacy far more valuable paths to resolving conflicts.
